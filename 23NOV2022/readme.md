## Vacation Destination

**You are going on a vacation in which you need to take multiple planes to get to your destination. You are given a list, flights, that represents a set of your flights. Each flight is a list itself that contains two elements, the departing city and the arriving city respectively. Return the destination city.
Note: The destination city is the city that does not contain an outgoing flight and it is guaranteed there is a unique answer.**


Ex: Given the following flights…
```
flights = [["A", "B"], ["B", "C"]], return "C".
```
